# Implement-pki-from-scratch
I created a PKI environment consisting of a Certificate Authority (CA), Registration Authority (RA) and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL). Issued 509.x certificates to users, approved certificate requests and revoked certificates. I use secure communication channels using TLS/SSL for certificate issuance and validation.
